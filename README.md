# Conversion-System-Between-Roman-And-Decimal-Numbers

## Introduction

#### About

The Roman-Decimal Converter is a simple web application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to convert Roman numerals to decimal (integer) values and vice versa. This application leverages object-oriented programming principles to achieve modular and reusable code.

#### How to run/use the program

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Save the provided Python script (converter.py) in your working directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the command: python converter.py
The application window will open, allowing you to input values and perform conversions.

*#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In my program:
The 'Converter class' defines a convert method which is implemented differently in 'RomanToDecimalConverter' and 'DecimalToRomanConverter'.

*#### Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. In this application:
The 'Converter class' abstracts the conversion logic by providing a common interface for conversion operations.
